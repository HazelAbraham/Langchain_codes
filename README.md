# Langchain_codes
This repo  will consitsof the langchain concepts   which I learned during the journey 

1. Langchain_simple_trial.py :

This notebook explores building applications with LangChain, focusing on integrating with the Groq API. It covers:
Setting up the environment and installing necessary libraries (langchain-groq, langgraph).

Accessing API keys securely using userdata.

Initializing and using the ChatGroq model for generating responses.

Utilizing output parsers like StrOutputParser to process model output.

Demonstrating the concept of LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) for chaining components (Prompt, Model, Parser).

Introducing the idea of agents and attempting to use a prebuilt agent with a search tool, although encountering an error due to a missing API key.
